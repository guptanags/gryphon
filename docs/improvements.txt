Prompt Engineering (Low Effort, High Impact): Update the 
coder_agent
 and 
planner_agent
 prompts with better persona definitions, Chain-of-Thought instructions, and few-shot examples.
Context Construction (Medium Effort): Implement the structured XML-like context format in 
agent_graph.py
 to help the LLM distinguish between files.
Data Ingestion Enhancements (High Effort): Update 
ingest.py
 to extract and index more metadata (docstrings, signatures) for better retrieval.
